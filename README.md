Through the access provided by the University 2035, I completed the Data Analysis program from Yandex.Practicum (it is about one-third of the full program in this area). 
The final project uploaded to this repository. The notebook was checked and accepted by the reviewer.
The project is quite large, so if you want to look at it, it is better to download the file and dataset and then run it all on your local machine, or through Google Collab. This file cannot be opened through Github.
